HR Employee Attrition Analysis

This project analyzes employee attrition data to uncover key factors that contribute to employees leaving the company. The goal is to help HR departments make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for HR teams. In this project, we explore a dataset of employee records to identify patterns and build insights about the causes of attrition using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

Python 

Pandas â€“ for data manipulation

NumPy â€“ for numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ for visualization

Jupyter Notebook â€“ for analysis and reporting

ðŸ“Š Key Steps in the Project

Data Import & Cleaning

Loaded HR dataset into Pandas DataFrame

Checked for missing or inconsistent data

Handled categorical and numerical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized employee demographics and job characteristics

Explored correlations between features and attrition rate

Created visual insights using bar charts, Boxplot, and histograms

Feature Analysis
